Problem - 3 : Gender Categorization 

Bollyood Movies data has been given to us with different kinds of datasets from wikipedia dataset,scripts of the movies,trailer dat, image datasets of the movies with these given datasets we have to find the gender male and female and categorize them from the datasets .The goal of the problem is to get the gender stereotypes from the bollyood movies Thus we find the basic solution with our machine learning algorithm.

Procedure:
1. First we have imported some python libraries.
2. Then we have imported our datasets that are given to us in the problem.
3. Then we have done some data processing with the given data.
4. Did the analyzation of the data provided using some commands.
5. Then we have converted the gender to 0s and 1s for better accesibility.
6. Next I split the dataset given using train and test split.
7. With the available data i had i used Naive Bayes Classifier.
8. Which helped to classify the gender using a algorithm.
9. Using digramatical representation displayed the data in pie , bar and histogram.
10. At the end we have concluded and got the accuracy of the given model.
